This algorithm is designed for Structual Reliability Analysis.

* distribution type *
1 : Normal
2 : Lognormal
3 : Gamma
4 : Shifted Exponential
5 : Shfited Rayleigh
6 : Uniform

FORM : 
- First Order Reliability Method

SORM :
- Second Order Reliability Method which is computed by curvature fitting
- Compute FORM and offer Breitung & Imporved Breitung failure probability

System Analysis: 
- Use Matrix-based System Reliability Method
- approximated by FORM & Dunnett - Sobel(DS) class

Monte Carlo Simulation
- Sampling analysis 

Importance Sampling
- Sample density ~ N(M = weighted sum of u_design, S = S_sample) weight = beta^(-m)
